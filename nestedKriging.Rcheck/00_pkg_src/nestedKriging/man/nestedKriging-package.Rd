The DESCRIPTION file:
\packageDESCRIPTION{nestedKriging}
\packageIndices{nestedKriging}
Nested Kriging is an interpolation technique which uses clusters of data in order to deal with larger datasets than usual Kriging techniques.

When a function \code{f} is observed only at some input points, the function \code{\link{nestedKriging}} computes nested Kriging predictions at some given prediction points. Observations are \code{Y=f(X)}, where response vector \code{Y} and design matrix \code{X} are given, and the \code{nestedKriging} function gives a prediction of \code{f(x)}. The function \code{nestedKriging} typically returns mean and variance of the predictor. It requires dividing the \eqn{n} input points into \eqn{N} subgroups. It first calculates Kriging predictor on each subgroups, and then aggregate predictors into a unique predictor. This way, it allows doing Kriging on larger datasets, as soon as \eqn{N} and \eqn{n/N} are not too large.

The package mainly contains the function \code{\link{nestedKriging}}, which gives the prediction mean and variance of a Nested Kriging predictor. For repeated call of this function, it is recommended to use the function \code{\link{nestedKrigingDirect}} which do not check input arguments.

After installation of the package, it is recommended to launch the function \code{\link{tests_run}} which launches tests and checks if multithreading is available on your system.
